# How to Install Open Voice OS with the `ovos-installer`

Welcome to the quick-start guide for installing Open Voice OS (OVOS) using the official `ovos-installer`! This guide is suitable for **Raspberry Pi** and **desktop/server** Linux environments. Whether you’re running this on a headless Raspberry Pi or your everyday laptop, the steps are mostly the same—only the way you connect to the device differs.

> ⚠️ Note: Some “exotic” hardware (like ReSpeaker microphones or certain audio HATs) may require extra configuration. The installer aims for wide compatibility, but specialized setups might need some manual intervention.

Looking for a pre-built raspberry pi image instead? check out [raspOVOS](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS) and the companion [tutorial](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/51-install_raspovos/)

## Step-by-step Installation

### ✅ 1. Connect to Your Device *(if remote)*

If you're installing on a headless device (like a Raspberry Pi), connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh -l your-username <your-device-ip>

```

---

### 🔄 2. Update Package Metadata

Make sure your package manager is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update

```

---

### 📦 3. Install Prerequisites

Install `git` and `curl`—these are required to run the installer:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git curl

```

---

### 📥 4. Run the OVOS Installer

Now you're ready to kick off the installation process:

```bash
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer/main/installer.sh)"

```

## What Happens Next?

Once you run the script, the installer will:

- Perform system checks


- Install dependencies (Python, Ansible, etc.)


- Launch a **text-based user interface (TUI)** to guide you through the setup

This can take anywhere from **5 to 20 minutes**, depending on your hardware, internet speed, and storage performance. Now let’s walk through the installer screens!

---

## The Installer Wizard

Navigation:

- navigation is done via arrow keys


- pressing space selects options in the lists


    - eg. when selecting `virtualenv` or `containers`


- pressing tab will switch between the options and the `<next>`/`<back>` buttons


- pressing enter will execute the highligted `<next>`/`<back>` option

---

### 🌍 Language Selection

The first screen lets you select your preferred language. Just follow the on-screen instructions.

### 🧠 Environment Summary

You’ll be shown a summary of the detected environment—no action needed here. It’s just informative.

### 🧰 Choose Installation Method

You have two choices:

- **Virtualenv**: Recommended for most users. Easier to understand and manage.


- **Containers**: For advanced users familiar with Docker or Podman.

---

### 🌱 Choose Channel

Select the **“development”** channel. Once OVOS is production-ready, a “stable” channel will also be available.

> ⚠️ Note: Some features (like the GUI) may be unavailable on lower-end hardware like the Raspberry Pi 3B+.

---

### 🍓 Raspberry Pi Tuning *(if applicable)*

On Raspberry Pi boards, you’ll be offered system tweaks to improve performance. It's highly recommended to enable this!

---

### 🧾 Summary

Before the installation begins, you'll see a summary of your selected options. This is your last chance to cancel the process.

### 📊 Anonymous Telemetry

You'll be asked whether to share **anonymous usage data** to help improve Open Voice OS. Please consider opting in!

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8015c41-370d-49d3-b783-996887cb421b)

The data collection only happens during the installation process, nothing else will be collected once the installation is over.

**The installer will ask you if you want to share or not the data.**

Below is a list of the collected data _(please have a look to the [Ansible tempalte](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer/blob/main/ansible/roles/ovos_installer/templates/telemetry.json.j2) used ti publish the data)_.

### 🧙‍♂️ Sit Back and Relax

The installation begins! This can take some time, so why not grab a coffee (or maybe a cupcake)? ☕🧁

Here is a demo of how the process should go if everything works as intended

## Installation Complete!

You’ve done it! OVOS is now installed and ready to serve you. Try saying things like:

- “What’s the weather?”


- “Tell me a joke.”


- “Set a timer for 5 minutes.”

## Additional Configuration and Known Issues

Depending on your language you probably want to change the default plugins, the ovos-installer is not perfect and might not always select the best defaults

It is recommend that you run `ovos-config autoconfigure --help` after the initial install
